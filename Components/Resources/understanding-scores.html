        <h1>Understanding Credit Scores</h1>
        <p>Credit scores are like adulting report cards. Let‚Äôs break it down so you can flex a high score and borrow like a boss.</p>

        <div class="box">
            <h2>What is a Credit Score? (AKA Your Adulting GPA)</h2>
            <p>A credit score is a magical number between <strong>300 and 850</strong> that tells lenders how responsible you are with borrowed money.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A **higher score** means lenders see you as **reliable** (you pay bills on time, you‚Äôre a responsible adult).</li>
                <li>A **lower score** means lenders see you as **risky** (you forgot to pay that one bill three years ago, and they‚Äôre still mad about it).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your credit score is basically your financial reputation‚Äîexcept you can‚Äôt wear sunglasses and pretend it doesn‚Äôt exist.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
            <h2>How is Your Credit Score Calculated?</h2>
            <p>Credit scores are determined by five mysterious factors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Payment History (35%)</strong> ‚Äì Did you pay your bills on time? (Late = Bad)</li>
                <li><strong>Credit Utilization (30%)</strong> ‚Äì How much credit are you using compared to what‚Äôs available? (High usage = Risky)</li>
                <li><strong>Credit History Length (15%)</strong> ‚Äì How long have you had credit? (Older accounts = Better)</li>
                <li><strong>New Credit Inquiries (10%)</strong> ‚Äì How often are you applying for new credit? (Too much = Desperate)</li>
                <li><strong>Credit Mix (10%)</strong> ‚Äì Do you have different types of credit? (Cards, loans, etc.)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
