        <h1>Debt Management: Taming the Debt Monster</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the **Debt Management** page‚Äîwhere we don‚Äôt judge your financial past, but we do help you wrestle that **debt monster** into submission.  
        If your wallet cries every time you check your bank account, this guide is for you!</p>

        <div class="box">
            <h2>Step 1: Face the Debt Monster (Denial is Not a Strategy)</h2>
            <p>The first rule of **debt management club** is: **Know your enemy.**</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Make a list of all your debts. Yes, even that one you pretend doesn‚Äôt exist.</li>
                <li>Include the **balance**, **interest rate**, and **minimum payment** for each.</li>
                <li>Take a deep breath‚Äîit‚Äôs just numbers. We‚Äôll make them smaller!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Think of your debt as a villain in an action movie. It may seem scary now, but with the right plan, you‚Äôll be the hero of your own financial comeback story.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
            <h2>Step 2: Choose Your Battle Plan</h2>
            <p>Now that you‚Äôve identified your financial nemesis, it‚Äôs time to pick your strategy.</p>

            <h3>üéØ The Snowball Method (For Quick Wins)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Best for:</strong> People who love small victories and motivation.</li>
                <li>Pay off your **smallest debt first**, regardless of interest rate.</li>
                <li>Once it‚Äôs gone, **roll that payment** into the next debt.</li>
                <li>Repeat until you‚Äôve obliterated your debt like a financial warrior.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>üí° **Why it works:** The psychological boost of seeing debts disappear keeps you motivated!</p>

            <h3>üöÄ The Avalanche Method (For Saving Money)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Best for:</strong> People who like to minimize interest costs and play the long game.</li>
                <li>Pay off the **highest interest debt first** while making minimum payments on the rest.</li>
                <li>Once it‚Äôs gone, **apply that payment to the next highest interest debt**.</li>
                <li>Keep going until your debt is buried under an avalanche of responsibility.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>üí° **Why it works:** You pay less in interest, meaning you get out of debt **faster and cheaper**.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
            <h2>Step 3: Attack with Extra Payments (Even Small Ones Count!)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Round up payments.</strong> If your minimum payment is $48, make it $50. Your future self will thank you.</li>
                <li><strong>Use windfalls.</strong> Tax refund? Birthday money? Bonus at work? Throw it at your debt instead of buying another gadget you‚Äôll forget about in two weeks.</li>
                <li><strong>Pay more than once a month.</strong> Biweekly payments can help reduce interest and knock debt out sooner.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
            <h2>Step 4: Avoid the Debt Trap (Don‚Äôt Let It Respawn)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Resist lifestyle inflation.</strong> Just because you‚Äôre making more money doesn‚Äôt mean you need a fancier car or a bigger TV.</li>
                <li><strong>Build an emergency fund.</strong> Even $500-$1000 can keep you from using credit cards when life throws curveballs.</li>
                <li><strong>Use credit wisely.</strong> Credit is a tool, not free money. If you wouldn‚Äôt buy it with cash, think twice before swiping.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
            <h2>Final Boss Fight: Becoming Debt-Free</h2>
            <p>Debt freedom is within reach! Once you pay everything off:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>‚úÖ Do a victory dance.</li>
                <li>‚úÖ Tell your debt it can‚Äôt sit with you anymore.</li>
                <li>‚úÖ Keep using the skills you learned to **build wealth instead of paying off past mistakes.**</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Debt may have won a few battles, but with this plan, you‚Äôll **win the war.** üèÜ</p>
